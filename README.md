# Paradigm Pool

### 3 week university program to learn the basics of Haskell, Modular C and C++ 

Each day has a folder with the completed exercises.   
The last day of each language is a project that is done in groups of 2 to 4 people.
Note that some days had a morning and afternoon session, so there are two folders for those days.

### Haskell

- Day 1: Introduction to Haskell
  - Syntax, recursion, type sets, local bindings, guards, pattern matching, lists, tuples, higher order functions, lambda functions...
- Day 2: Monads
  - Deriving, type signatures, type inference, polymorphism, monomorphism, monads, do notation, IO, applicatives, monoids, IO monad, state monad, monad transformers, do notation, currying, fancy values...
- Day 3: Instances and Typeclasses
  - Recursive types, custom types, objects data types, functors, folds...

### Haskell Project (Duo)

Program that takes an integer list and set of operations and checks for sorting.   
The game is made up of two linked lists of numbers named l_a and l_b.

### Modular C

- Day 4: C lang review
  - Constness, storage classes, casts, inline functions, list, queues, stack implementations, unit tests...
- Day 5: Function pointers
  - Memory allocation, function pointers, string operations, unit tests...

### C Project (4 people)

Modular C program (C++ mimic) with lists, queues, iterators, stacks, vectors, maps, arrays implementations.

### C++

- Day 6: Introduction to C++
  - Auto, member functions, default constructors, custom constructors, destructors, visibility, IOstreams, IOmanip, strings
- Day 7:
  - Parametric polymorphism, default values, namespaces, pointer to member variables, pointer to member functions, static, explicit, new, delete, new[] and delete[], smart pointers, smart pointers in stdlib, const methods, references
- Day 8:
  - Coplien form (canonical), default delete, operator overloading assignment, operator overloading in class, operator overloading out of class
- Day 9:
  - Inheritance, protected, multiple and virtual inheritance, constructor linkage, inheritance polymorphism, override, final, abstract classes
- Day 10:
  - Casts, static casts, dynamic casts, reinterpret casts, const casts, c style casts
- Day 11 and 12:
  - Exceptions, object lifetimes, exceptions in the stdlib, noexcept, custom excpetions, try/catch, multiple types catching and nested classes
- Day 13:
  - Templates, type deduction, class templates, multiple parameters templates, iterators, range-based for loop, std::function

### C++ Project (3 people)

System monitor program that displays information about the system and processes in a window with SFML and in terminal via nCurses.
See its project README for building and installation instructions.
